- Handles player spawning and registration

### NetworkKartController : NetworkBehaviour
- Player kart network synchronization
- Position and rotation updates via NetworkTransform
- Lap tracking with NetworkVariable

## Player Synchronization

### Essential State Data
- Transform data (handled by NetworkTransform)
- Current lap (NetworkVariable)
- Race position (NetworkVariable)

### Basic Latency Handling
- Built-in Unity interpolation
- NetworkTransform smoothing

## Game Flow

### Session Management
1. Host/Join functionality (Unity Relay Service)
2. Race start countdown (ServerRpc)
3. Race completion synchronization

### Data Structures
```json
PlayerState {
    NetworkVariable<string> "playerID",
    NetworkVariable<int> "currentLap",
    NetworkVariable<bool> "isFinished"
}

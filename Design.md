# HW KartKlash

## Game Concept

A multiplayer racing game set on the Harvard-Westlake campus. Players race go-karts around a track that follows the actual layout of the school grounds, featuring iconic locations and challenging terrain.

## Track Layout Example

The race track follows a circuit around the Harvard-Westlake campus:

- **Starting Line**: Begins on the straight path leading from the quad toward the security guard kiosk
- **First Section**: Leads into the parking lot with spikes and a challenging dip
- **Second Section**: Navigates through a narrow passage in the main parking lot
- **Third Section**: Curves back up toward the security kiosk
- **Fourth Section**: Right turn onto the steep fire road leading up to St. Saviour's Chapel
- **Fifth Section**: Behind the chapel is another steep descent into the teacher parking lot
- **Sixth Section**: Route continues toward Weiler Hall
- **Seventh Section**: Features a ramp from Weiler Hall up to Mudd Library
- **Eighth Section**: Path from library through the spire to Rugby Theatre
- **Final Section**: Through the quad back to the starting line

## Game Features

- All racing karts have identical performance specifications
- Players can choose from different Harvard-Westlake teachers as drivers
    - Each teacher character has 2 unique special abilities:
        - 1st: based on the subject they teach (general)
        - 2nd: based on their personality (specific)  
- Racers can collect various powerups throughout the track
- There are multiple maps you can go through instead of just one
    - ex. All-roof path, all-stairs path, cafeteria route, etc
- Feature for with/without "railings" where there are railings on the edges of the paths to make it easier for new players
- hidden shortcuts
- moving obsacles 
    - lizards, students, etc

### Powerups
- Trigonometry: release waves of sin curves that pushes other players back
- Supply & Demand: allows you to steal a powerup from another player, since you have higher demand
- Falling grades: create pools of "F"s on the floor that will slow other players down bc depression

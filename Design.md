# HW KartKlash

## Game Concept

A multiplayer racing game set on the Harvard-Westlake campus. Players race go-karts around a track that follows the actual layout of the school grounds, featuring iconic locations and challenging terrain.

## Track Layout

The race track follows a circuit around the Harvard-Westlake campus:

- **Starting Line**: Begins on the straight path leading from the quad toward the security guard kiosk
- **First Section**: Leads into the parking lot with spikes and a challenging dip
- **Second Section**: Navigates through a narrow passage in the main parking lot
- **Third Section**: Curves back up toward the security kiosk
- **Fourth Section**: Right turn onto the steep fire road leading up to St. Saviour's Chapel
- **Fifth Section**: Behind the chapel is another steep descent into the teacher parking lot
- **Sixth Section**: Route continues toward Weiler Hall
- **Seventh Section**: Features a ramp from Weiler Hall up to Mudd Library
- **Eighth Section**: Path from library through the spire to Rugby Theatre
- **Final Section**: Through the quad back to the starting line

## Cafeteria Chaos Section:
Midway through the race, players burst through the double doors of the Harvard-Westlake cafeteria—only to instantly shrink to the size of a salt shaker. Inside this chaotic micro-course, the familiar lunchroom transforms into a maze of oversized obstacles: towering cartons of milk, sliding meatballs, bouncing apples, and puddles of spilled Gatorade that act like sticky traps. The real danger, however, is Pyrough—the cafeteria worker—who stomps through the kitchen with a giant ladle, trying to squash the tiny racers. Players must weave between food trays and silverware while avoiding Pyrough’s surprise attacks, adding a thrilling and surreal twist to the course.

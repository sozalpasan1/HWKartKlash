# HW KartKlash

## Game Concept

A multiplayer racing game set on the Harvard-Westlake campus. Players race go-karts around a track that follows the actual layout of the school grounds, featuring iconic locations and challenging terrain.

## Track Layout

The race track follows a circuit around the Harvard-Westlake campus:

- **Starting Line**: Begins on the straight path leading from the quad toward the security guard kiosk
- **First Section**: Leads into the parking lot with spikes and a challenging dip
- **Second Section**: Navigates through a narrow passage in the main parking lot
- **Third Section**: Curves back up toward the security kiosk
- **Fourth Section**: Right turn onto the steep fire road leading up to St. Saviour's Chapel
- **Fifth Section**: Behind the chapel is another steep descent into the teacher parking lot
- **Sixth Section**: Route continues toward Weiler Hall
- **Seventh Section**: Features a ramp from Weiler Hall up to Mudd Library
- **Eighth Section**: Path from library through the spire to Rugby Theatre
- **Final Section**: Through the quad back to the starting line

## Game Features

- All racing karts have identical performance specifications
- Players can choose from different Harvard-Westlake teachers as drivers
- Each teacher character has unique special abilities
- Racers can collect various powerups throughout the track
- *minor feature 1*: Players can view stats, like laptimes, in a menu.
- *minor feature 2*: Players can start a time trial, which loads them onto the map without any other players. This will allow people to practice the map and have fun with the game, even when they cannot find other players to join them in game.

### New Feature 1: Proximity Voice Chat

Proximity Chat allows players to hear and talk to players nearby them. This will allow for more engaging gameplay, as passing other players and contention between indiviual rankings will be more exciting. When not in a race, this voice channel will open to all players. Volume should also scale with distance, with farther players being quieter than closer players. Because this is based on distance, you should also be able to vaguely overhear seperate areas of the track, leading to funny out of context moments.

### New Feature 2: Drive to Survive Gamemode

Instead of a conventional race where players compete to cross a finish line or complete a certain amount of laps, this gamemode has players try to kick other players off the track. This could be done via shoving them off high spots, using specific power ups, or via other means. This gamemode would be less repetitive than laps on a single track, and would make for more interesting gameplay.

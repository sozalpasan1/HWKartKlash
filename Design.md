# HW KartKlash

## Game Concept

A multiplayer racing game set on the Harvard-Westlake campus. Players race go karts around a track that follows the actual layout of the school grounds, featuring iconic locations and challenging terrain.

## Track Layout

The race track follows a circuit around the Harvard-Westlake campus:

- Begins on the straight path leading from the quad toward the security guard kiosk
- Leads into the parking lot with spikes and a challenging dip
- Navigates through a narrow passage in the main parking lot
- Curves back up toward the security kiosk
- Right turn onto the steep fire road leading up to St. Saviour's Chapel
- Behind the chapel is another steep descent into the teacher parking lot
- Route continues toward Weiler Hall
- Winds around the track once or twice
- Goes up through Chalmers (reminicient of Luigi's haunted mansion)
- Features a ramp from Weiler Hall up to Mudd Library
- Path from library through the spire to Rugby Theatre
- Through the quad back to the starting line

Track 2:
- **Starting Line**: Begins at the pool
- **First Section**: Leads into the track and loops around it
- **Second Section**: Exits near Taper gym stairs
- **Third Section**: Passes through Munger up to the sophomore quad
- **Fourth Section**:  Heads down to the main quad, then right into the back entrance of Chaulmers
- **Fifth Section**: Travels through chaulmers and down to the cafeteria
- **Sixth Section**: Goes down stairs to North entrance
- **Seventh Section**: Leaves out North entrance and reenters campus main entrance by pool
- **Final Section**: Through Taper to the pool

## Game Features

- All racing karts have identical performance specifications
- Players can choose from different Harvard-Westlake teachers as drivers
- Each teacher character has unique special abilities
- Racers can collect various powerups throughout the track

#Ideas
- Campus is animated (mario kart-style)
- Students are roaming in certain areas on the track. If you hit them, your car will lose a lot of speed, they will turn into ragdolls and bleed, and Mr. Preciado will fly down on a cloud and scold you. Other obstacles - backpacks, tables cause you to lose speed to a lesser extent. 
- Hard mode: obstacles cause you to lose health, and if you lose too much health your kart blows up and you don't finish the race. Bigger vehicles have more health.
- Karts are customizable with different vehicles, wheels, and colors; different parts give different stats, have pros/continues
    - Customizable, but NOT upgradeable
    - the only advantage experienced players should have over new players is their experience
- at the end of each race, if you get first place, your prize is that mr. commons and buddy the wolverine fall into your kart. buddy is beside you and commons is riding in the back. buddy leans over and gives you a hug, and mr. commons says that you're his most favoritest student, and gives you a diploma. you look at the diploma and its the standings of the race
- some of the carts are actually based on cars you could find at school
    - the golf carts that the security drives, the cars that are always parked on the track, all those light blue subaru crosstreks, that one red/green pickup truck, the garbage trucks, etc
    - the different karts have different acceleration, handling, top speed, weight/mass (less affected by obstacles, and lets you slam into other cars)
- Minimap in bottom left
- Depending on where you are on the track (e.g. parking lot or library) the type of power-up or item you can get differs (e.g. parking pass throwable or a book)
- Customize weather for each race, weather changes race conditions (rain increases chance of slipping off the track). The effects of weather also vary by vehicle type. Weather could be:
    - rain
    - heat wave (increases traction and handling off all vehicles)
    - snow (snow can blind you for a couple seconds, patches of snow on the ground slow you down)
    - Fog decreases visibility by a lot
    - Hail could just be a weather option for hard mode that decreases the health of your kart. You can dodge the hail to decrease the chance of losing health. 
- Wolverscreens around campus show current race standings, time elapsed, other race stats. Designed in the same format as actual Wolverscreens.
- VOICE LINES FOR EACH TEACHER (TBD)
- leaderboard for fastest ever times for each map, you can check it in between games by clicking on map details. Map details also shows a preview of the map.

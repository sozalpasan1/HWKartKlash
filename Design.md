# HW KartKlash

## Game Concept

A multiplayer racing game set on the Harvard-Westlake campus. Players race go karts around a track that follows the actual layout of the school grounds, featuring iconic locations and challenging terrain.

## Track Layout

The race track follows a circuit around the Harvard-Westlake campus:

- Begins on the straight path leading from the quad toward the security guard kiosk
- Leads into the parking lot with spikes and a challenging dip
- Navigates through a narrow passage in the main parking lot
- Curves back up toward the security kiosk
- Right turn onto the steep fire road leading up to St. Saviour's Chapel
- Behind the chapel is another steep descent into the teacher parking lot
- Route continues toward Weiler Hall
- Winds around the track once or twice
- Goes up through Chalmers (reminicient of Luigi's haunted mansion)
- Features a ramp from Weiler Hall up to Mudd Library
- Path from library through the spire to Rugby Theatre
- Through the quad back to the starting line

Track 2:
- **Starting Line**: Begins at the pool
- **First Section**: Leads into the track and loops around it
- **Second Section**: Exits near Taper gym stairs
- **Third Section**: Passes through Munger up to the sophomore quad
- **Fourth Section**:  Heads down to the main quad, then right into the back entrance of Chaulmers
- **Fifth Section**: Travels through chaulmers and down to the cafeteria
- **Sixth Section**: Goes down stairs to North entrance
- **Seventh Section**: Leaves out North entrance and reenters campus main entrance by pool
- **Final Section**: Through Taper to the pool

## Game Features

- All racing karts have identical performance specifications
- Players can choose from different Harvard-Westlake teachers as drivers
- Each teacher character has unique special abilities
- Racers can collect various powerups throughout the track

#Ideas
- The campus is fully photoreal ~~(A lesser man would say something about NeRFs or lidar scanning but that would be technical)~~
- Students are roaming in certain areas on the track. If you hit them, your car will lose a lot of speed, they will turn into ragdolls and bleed, and Mr. Prosciutto will fly down on a cloud and scold you.
- Karts are customizable with different vehicles, wheels, and colors; different parts give different stats, have pros/continues
    Customizable, but NOT upgradeable
    the only advantage experienced players should have over new players is their experience
    the different karts have different accelerat
- at the end of each race, if you get first place, your prize is that mr. commons and buddy the wolverine fall into your kart. buddy is beside you and commons is riding in the back. buddy leans over and gives you a hug, and mr. commons says that you're his most favoritest student, and gives you a diploma. you look at the diploma and its the standings of the race
- some of the carts are actually based on cars you could find at school
    the golf carts that the security drives, the cars that are always parked on the track, all those light blue subaru crosstreks, that one red/green pickup truck, the garbage trucks, etc
- Minimap
- Depending on where you are on the track (e.g. parking lot or library) the type of power-up or item you can get differs (e.g. parking pass throwable or a book)

- Add weather, modifications to the map
- Random obstacles can affect the race; backpacks, students, tables, etc. Preciado could force you to navigate a more narrow path or make the race harder in some way.
- Less important features: Kart customization, Wolverscreens around campus show current race standings, time elapsed, other race stats
- VOICE LINES FOR EACH TEACHER

# HW KartKlash

## Game Concept

A multiplayer racing game set on the Harvard-Westlake campus. Players race go-karts around a track that follows the actual layout of the school grounds, featuring iconic locations and challenging terrain.

## Track Layout

The race track follows a circuit around the Harvard-Westlake campus:

- **Starting Line**: Begins on the straight path leading from the quad toward the security guard kiosk
- **First Section**: Leads into the parking lot with spikes and a challenging dip
- **Second Section**: Navigates through a narrow passage in the main parking lot
- **Third Section**: Curves back up toward the security kiosk
- **Fourth Section**: Right turn onto the steep fire road leading up to St. Saviour's Chapel
- **Fifth Section**: Behind the chapel is another steep descent into the teacher parking lot
- **Sixth Section**: Route continues toward Weiler Hall
- **Seventh Section**: Features a ramp from Weiler Hall up to Mudd Library
- **Eighth Section**: Path from library through the spire to Rugby Theatre
- **Final Section**: Through the quad back to the starting line

## Game Features

- All racing karts have identical performance specifications
- Players can choose from different Harvard-Westlake teachers as drivers
- Each teacher character has unique special abilities
- Racers can collect various powerups throughout the track

Aviv + Nathaniel Ideas:
* Ability for people to choose different routes throught the school - routes have different features but takes a similar amount of time. 
* In-game currency in order to purhcase skins, upgrades, teachers, etc. 
* Weather, time of day, seasons

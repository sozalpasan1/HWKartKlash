# HW KartKlash

## Game Concept

A multiplayer racing game set on the Harvard-Westlake campus. Players race go karts around a track that follows the actual layout of the school grounds, featuring iconic locations and challenging terrain.

## Track Layout

The race track follows a circuit around the Harvard-Westlake campus:

- Begins on the straight path leading from the quad toward the security guard kiosk
- Leads into the parking lot with spikes and a challenging dip
- Navigates through a narrow passage in the main parking lot
- Curves back up toward the security kiosk
- Right turn onto the steep fire road leading up to St. Saviour's Chapel
- Behind the chapel is another steep descent into the teacher parking lot
- Route continues toward Weiler Hall
- Winds around the track once or twice
- Goes up through Chalmers (reminicient of Luigi's haunted mansion)
- Features a ramp from Weiler Hall up to Mudd Library
- Path from library through the spire to Rugby Theatre
- Through the quad back to the starting line

Track 2:
- **Starting Line**: Begins at the pool
- **First Section**: Leads into the track and loops around it
- **Second Section**: Exits near Taper gym stairs
- **Third Section**: Passes through Munger up to the sophomore quad
- **Fourth Section**:  Heads down to the main quad, then right into the back entrance of Chaulmers
- **Fifth Section**: Travels through chaulmers and down to the cafeteria
- **Sixth Section**: Goes down stairs to North entrance
- **Seventh Section**: Leaves out North entrance and reenters campus main entrance by pool
- **Final Section**: Through Taper to the pool

## Game Features

- All racing karts have identical performance specifications
- Players can choose from different Harvard-Westlake teachers as drivers
- Each teacher character has unique special abilities
- Racers can collect various powerups throughout the track
- The campus is fully photoreal ~~(A lesser man would say something about NeRFs or lidar scanning but that would be technical)~~
- Karts are customizable with different vehicles, wheels, and colors
- Karts can drift to decrease their turn radius
- Students are roaming in certain areas on the track. If you hit them, your car will lose a lot of speed, they will turn into ragdolls and bleed, and Mr. Prosciutto will fly down on a cloud and scold you.

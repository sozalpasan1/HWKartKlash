- **Third Section**: Curves back up toward the security kiosk
- **Fourth Section**: traverse up towards the steep fire road leading up to St. Saviour's Chapel
- **Fifth Section**: Behind the chapel is another steep descent(making an artificial ramp) into the teacher parking lot. or there is an alternate route up near the admissions buliding where there is a ramp that launches you up into the air and you land onto the exit of the faculty lot. 
- **Sixth Section**: Route continues toward Weiler Hall and to around the track with obstacles
- **Seventh Section**: drives up the bleachers leading to lower quad, then to upper quad then to the cafeteria 
- **Eighth Section**: Exit the cafeteria and goes through the main pathway to the taper gym, and through the taper gym
- **Final Section**: exits the taper gym and goes up the handicap ramp and restarts the lap at the entry of the parking lot.

## Developed Map Ideas:
### Cafeteria Chaos:

- Once the players enter the quad the final section, they must go through the cafeteria. 
- players burst through the double doors of the Harvard-Westlake cafeteria‚Äîonly to instantly shrink to the size of a salt shaker.
- the cafeteria transforms into a maze of oversized obstacles: towering cartons of milk, sliding meatballs, bouncing apples, and puddles of spilled Gatorade that act like sticky traps.
- all while pyro is chasing you with a giant ladel, stomping on the ground. if this ladel makes contact with a cart, it sends the cart spinning out to the side.
- players enter through the cafeteria entrance and circle around the middle counter, and then they exit through the checkout station and must get checked out

## Powerups

- Racers can drift for a tiered speed boost based off of drift time

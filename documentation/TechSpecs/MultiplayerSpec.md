### Basic Implementation Steps
1. Network Manager Setup
   - Create an empty GameObject in the scene
   - Add NetworkManager component
   - Configure Transport (Default: Unity Transport)

2. Network Object Setup
   - Add NetworkObject component to GameObjects that need networking
   - Add NetworkBehaviour scripts for custom network logic
   - Configure object spawning preferences in NetworkManager

3. Basic Network Components
   - NetworkTransform: Sync position/rotation
   - NetworkAnimator: Sync animations
   - NetworkVariable<T>: Sync custom data

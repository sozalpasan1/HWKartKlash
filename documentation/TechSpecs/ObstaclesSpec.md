# HW KartKlash - ObstacleSpec.md

## Overview

This document outlines the technical specifications for implementing dynamic obstacle systems in the HW KartKlash racing game. The focus is on creating believable, interactive obstacles that enhance gameplay by providing challenges while maintaining the fun, arcade-style racing experience.

## Feature 1: Student Obstacles

**Related Design Elements**: 
> "Students are roaming in certain areas on the track. The 1-3 students are placed randomly on the track walking back and forth in a line at a steady pace. If you hit them, your car will lose a lot of speed, they will turn into ragdolls and bleed, and Mr. Preciado will fly down on a cloud and scold you."

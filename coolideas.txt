Major Changes:
1. Customizable karts
    Customizable, but NOT upgradeable
    the only advantage experienced players should have over new players is their experience
    the different karts have different accelerat
2. Story Mode!
    theres like a series of races with dialogue and a main enemy and stuff. or like a plot.
    they get harder and harder and maybe theres even some added features in certain levels.
    like a boss that shoots things at you, or dynamically adds holes to the map that you can fall through


Minor Changes:
1. some of the carts are actually based on cars you could find at school
    the golf carts that the security drives, the cars that are always parked on the track, all those light blue subaru crosstreks, that one red/green pickup truck, etc

2. leaderboard for fastest ever times for each map
